# About Me

I'm currently a junior undergraduate student majoring in Robot Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, China.

As a member of the algorithm department of Harbin Institute of Technology, I am mainly responsible for coding and designing the control algorithm and auto-aim algorithm for the robots in the Robomaster 2021/2022. In 2022, I became the deputy captain of the team and leader of the algorithm department, mainly responsible for developing high performance robot detection and tracking algorithm and designing maneuvering target prediction algorithm. We both won the Second Prize in the final round competitions of Robomaster 2021.

Finding meaning in my work is important to me. I prefer to work with passionate teams on projects with the potential to bend the future of humanity towards better outcomes.

Hoping to contribute to open source robotics.
