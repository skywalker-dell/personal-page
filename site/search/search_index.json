In 2022, I became the deputy captain of the team and leader of the algorithm department, mainly responsible for developing high performance robot detection and tracking algorithm and designing maneuvering target prediction algorithm. We both won the Second Prize in the final round competitions of Robomaster 2021. Finding meaning in my work is important to me. I prefer to work with passionate teams on projects with the potential to bend the future of humanity towards better outcomes.","title":"Overview"},{"location":"#about-me","text":"I'm currently a junior undergraduate student majoring in Robot Engineering at Harbin Institute of Technology, China.
